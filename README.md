I have created a new Typing Speed Test game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
This project allows users to test their typing speed within a specified time.
It calculates the number of mistakes made, Words Per Minute (WPM), and Characters Per Minute (CPM).
Additionally, the remaining time is displayed on the screen, making it easy to track progress. 
The game is user-friendly and designed to provide an engaging typing experience.
